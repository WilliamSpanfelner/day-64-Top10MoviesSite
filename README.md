# Top 10 Movie Site 🎬.
- 👋 Hi, I’m @WilliamSpanfelner
- 👀 I’m interested in using Python with Swift in iOS environments and why it may or may not be desirable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python with the London App Brewery and Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: 
The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) on Udemy.  
- 🧑‍💻 This Top 10 Movie Site project showcases a list of your favourite movies.  The length of the list is limited by the constraints of your computer's storage capabilty.  The project uses Python, a Flask server, HTML templates, Jinja calls to the TMDB API for film data, and SQLAlchemy to present and edit the contents of the database.  SQLite databases 💽 allows for persistent local data storage in this virual bookshelf project where books are rated for enjoyment factor. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development.
- 📫 How to reach me...
